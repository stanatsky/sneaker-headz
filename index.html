          The Air Jordan 1 High debuted in 1985 as the first signature sneaker
          developed by Nike for Michael Jordan. The Peter Moore designed
          performance basketball sneaker featured a simple Nike Dunk inspired
          design that incorporated the Nike Swoosh and the Jordan Wings logo and
          featured Nike Air.

          Michael Jordan's second signature model, the Air Jordan 2 first
          debuted in November 1986, and was designed by Bruce Killgore/Peter
          Moore. Created with high-end luxury in mind, the AJ2 was notable for
          its rich leather upper, lizard skin-style detailing, and noticeable
          lack of a Swoosh
